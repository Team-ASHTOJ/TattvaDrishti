# Styles Overview (frontend/styles/)

Purpose
- Reserve space for styling assets that complement Tailwind utility classes.

Current styling approach
- Tailwind CSS is the primary styling system.
- globals.css in app/ defines base layers and global tokens.
- Tailwind configuration is in frontend/tailwind.config.js.

Design intent
- Fast iteration with consistent visual language across dashboards.
- Component-first styling with minimal bespoke CSS.
